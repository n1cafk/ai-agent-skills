# Frontend Design

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth.

## NEVER Use
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- Clichéd color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context.
